📊 Project Overview
This project aims to analyze human resources data to provide actionable insights into employee attrition and performance patterns. The dashboard is designed to help organizations transition from reactive to proactive talent management.

🔍 Key Insights & Impact
Attrition Analysis: Identified a 16.1% turnover rate, revealing that every 6th desk becomes vacant, leading to significant replacement costs.

Burnout Risk: Analysis shows that overtime pay is not a sustainable solution; high attrition among overtime workers suggests burnout is a major retention risk.

Generational Needs: Younger talents with longer commutes show higher exit rates, making hybrid work models or logistical solutions a business necessity rather than a choice.

Performance & Career Path: Highlighted critical 10-year promotion bottlenecks for top performers, which directly impacts long-term loyalty.
